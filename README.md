# üéì BachelorPROJECT

A multi-language compilation of code samples and compiler experiments created for a Bachelor's level academic project. This repository explores basic programming concepts, compiler design, and executable generation using various technologies.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each focusing on a different language or compiler-related task:

- **[CPlusPlusBasicCode](./CPlusPlusBasicCode)**  
  Contains foundational C++ programs demonstrating syntax, control structures, and basic algorithms.

- **[CompilerForEXECommandWithPython](./CompilerForEXECommandWithPython)**  
  Python scripts designed to compile and execute code via command-line interfaces.

- **[CompilerWithCplusplus](./CompilerWithCplusplus)**  
  A C++-based compiler implementation or wrapper for compiling source files into executables.

- **[PhPCode](./PhPCode)**  
  PHP scripts showcasing basic web development or scripting logic.
